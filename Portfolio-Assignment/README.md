 Since , the course that I am persuing is an online certification, so firstly, my target audience are my educators who has helped me to acheive this website today. Furthuremore, in the future i would love to represent my website to a company as a part of my interview, so that I persue more knowledge in the fields of the features that I have used in my project.
